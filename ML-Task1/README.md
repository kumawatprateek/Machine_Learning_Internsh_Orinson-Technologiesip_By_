# Object Detection in Images

## Overview

This repository contains a project on **Object Detection in Images** using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The objective of this project is to accurately detect and classify objects in various images using pre-trained models or custom-trained models. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries like `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`, and `Matplotlib`.

## Features

- Detects multiple objects in a single image.
- Uses pre-trained models such as **YOLO**, **SSD**, or **Faster R-CNN** for high accuracy and performance.
- Capable of handling various image formats and resolutions.
- Generates bounding boxes around detected objects and labels them with class names and confidence scores.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `Object Detection in Images.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the object detection pipeline.
- `images/`: A folder containing the sample images used for object detection.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models used for detecting objects.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-in-images.git
   cd object-detection-in-images
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to execute the object detection pipeline:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Object\ Detection\ in\ Images.ipynb
   ```

4. You can replace the sample images in the `images/` folder with your own images to test the object detection capabilities.

## Results

The object detection model outputs images with bounding boxes around detected objects, along with class labels and confidence scores. Here's an example of an output image:
